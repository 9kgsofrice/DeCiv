# DeCiv
The nations of the past are no more. Rebuild one that can survive in the new world, if you can.

Thanks for trying DeCiv. The game has been rebalanced; food and resources are scarce. Barbarians are more dangerous than you might expect.

Please contact me through Github or Discord if you find bugs or have suggestions!

You are free to use any assets from this mod; please provide credit to me if you do. Thanks :)
