Changelog for 28.11.20
Resolved some issues preventing mod loading in latest version of Unciv (3.11.15)

"Mobility" promotion is now "Reconnaissance", provides Ignore Terrain Cost and XP boost, but has combat penalties in open terrain and vs city. Marksman/Sharpshooter now starts with Reconnaissance promotion

Patriot Marine and Spec Ops now require Armory to build; Slight buff to Marine strength; Patriots cannot build low tech combat units

Legion now can be trained from Iron Working, cost decreased slightly, requires Forge to build. Crimon Legion can train Soldiers from Rifling on par with other nations

Slightly buffed Scout strength

Increased Water income from Monopoly policy tree

Some changes to building tree balance




The nations of the past are no more. Rebuild one that can survive in the new world, if you can.

Thanks for trying DeCiv. The game has been rebalanced; food and resources are scarce. Barbarians are more dangerous than you might expect.
